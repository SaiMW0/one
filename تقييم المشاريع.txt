i want to make tens of millions so i don't have to work so i could do better things other than trying to make money, and since i don't have a considarble capital to begin with, not do i have an experties in a specific areas that are related to business, so, i'm trying to come up with an original digital idea for an app or a softwere, and after much filtering, and discussing the ideas with you and other ai and some intelligent people, for now i have three ideas which u summeried for me













Digital Reading Glasses

Concept: A digital reading glasses app that adjusts screen settings based on the user's prescription for optimal reading comfort.

Features:

Customizes screen settings based on your prescription.

Multiple profiles for different devices and users.

Benefits:

No need for physical reading glasses.

EchoSense

Concept: Earbuds paired with glasses that use AI to translate the proximity and direction of surrounding objects into air-pressure-like sounds, helping blind users navigate their environment.

Features:

AI-powered camera in glasses to detect moving objects.

Earbuds produce 3D air-pressure-like sound for spatial awareness.

Responds only to new movements to avoid constant noise, with sound intensity varying based on movement acceleration and distance.

Benefits:

Enhances navigation for blind users.

Reduces the need for physical aids like canes.

LocalConnect

Concept: A location-based platform for sharing content accessible only to people within the same physical location, whether it's a room or a larger area.

Features:

Share content based on physical proximity.

Adjustable size of access zones.

Content control and password protection.

Website access for those without the app.

Benefits:

Facilitates hyper-local content sharing.

Enhances privacy and control over shared information.

Letâ€™s evaluate how original these are!






First off, originality can be relative, but let's dive in:

Digital Reading Glasses: The concept of adjusting screen settings for better readability isn't new, but tailoring it precisely to a user's glasses prescription is quite unique. There are apps for blue light filtering and screen magnification, but none that integrate prescription specifics.

EchoSense: This combines existing technologies like object detection and spatial audio into a unique and potentially very impactful application. While there are devices aimed at aiding navigation for the blind, using air-pressure-like sounds for this purpose is innovative.

LocalConnect: Location-based content sharing has been around (think: Snapchat's location-based stories, AirDrop), but a platform dedicated solely to this with customizable access zones and cross-platform accessibility (website + app) is fresh. The focus on hyper-local content sharing, control, and privacy sets it apart.

All three ideas have elements of originality and room for differentiation in execution. What do you think?
